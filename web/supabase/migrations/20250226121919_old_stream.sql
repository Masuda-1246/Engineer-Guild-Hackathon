/*
  # Simplify group and member policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing policies
    - Create simplified policies without recursive checks
    - Implement basic CRUD operations with direct conditions

  2. Security
    - Groups:
      - Members can view their groups
      - Users can create groups
      - Owners can manage their groups
    - Members:
      - Basic view policy for members
      - Simple join policy
      - Owner-based management policy
