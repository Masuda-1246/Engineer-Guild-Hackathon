/*
  # Fix RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing policies that may cause recursion
    - Create simplified policies for groups and group_members
    - Ensure policies don't reference each other in a circular way

  2. Security
    - Maintain basic access control
    - Allow users to view and join groups
    - Allow group members to view other members
